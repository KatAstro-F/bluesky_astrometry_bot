# Bluesky Astrometry Bot 

This repository hosts a Bluesky bot that performs astrometry on images mentioned in posts. When the bot is mentioned in a post containing an image, it analyzes the image using nova.astrometry.net and replies with:
When you post an image :
![test image Bubble Nebula](https://github.com/KatAstro-F/bluesky_astrometry_bot/blob/main/ressources/test-image.jpg)
The bot will reply with :
* An annotated image highlighting detected celestial objects
    
![Annotated image](https://github.com/KatAstro-F/bluesky_astrometry_bot/blob/main/ressources/12213519_annotated_full.png)

* A list of objects found in the field
![objects in field image](https://github.com/KatAstro-F/bluesky_astrometry_bot/blob/main/ressources/objects.jpg)

* Two sky maps at different scales

## Installation

    Clone this repository.
    Install the required Python packages. 

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    (Ensure you have pip and Python 3.7+ installed.)

## Configuration

You need to create a `credentials.py` file at the root of the project. This file should contain a dictionary with your botâ€™s credentials and API key. For example:

```python
credentials = {
    "botname": "your-bot-name",
    "BLUESKY_USERNAME": "your-bot-username.bsky.social",
    "BLUESKY_PASSWORD": "your-bluesky-password",
    "API_KEY": "your-astrometry-api-key"
}
```

# Run the bot

### One shot
```bash
python bot.py
```

### From cron task (example: every 5 minutes)
This script avoids re-entrance and relaunches the bot in case of a crash:
```bash
run_astrometry.sh
```

The bot will listen for mentions on Bluesky, download attached images, run astrometry via nova.astrometry.net, and post a reply with the results.
